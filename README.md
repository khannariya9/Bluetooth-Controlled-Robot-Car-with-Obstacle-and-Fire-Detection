It is an Arduino based robot car which can work in two modes namely the Bluetooth and ultrasonic mode. The Bluetooth mode works when we connect our robot car with the mobile device like an android application. In ultrasonic mode it works as an obstacle detection device. The project also has an incorporated flame sensor which works in the ultrasonic mode. Hence, when the robot car detects fire it rings on the buzzer, moves behind and again analyses where to go therefore, working as an autonomous device.
